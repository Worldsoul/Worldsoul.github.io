				<h3>History:</h3>

				<p>I started this project a year and a half after I saw an online author give up on a story that had much merit, and could have eventually been published.</p>

				<p>The author, Lions, stopped because he had suffered an excess of negative comments and messages complaining about updates. This is wrong. Authors should not lose the will to write because they are harrassed online.</p>

				<p>That is why I made this site, Midstorm Repository. A site dedicated to equality and creating a positive enviornment for authors to write in.</p>

				<h3>Organization:</h3> 

				<p>Midstorm Repository is organized in a series of six ranks: Guests, Members, Proofreaders, Advanced Proofreader, Moderaters, and the Founder.</p> 
				<p>Guests are people without an account on the site. they can visit, but not comment on or post stories.</p>
				<p>Members are people who haved signed up to Midstorm Repository. they may post commentson stories as well as stories themselves. Members are banned if they are found in violation of the rules, and their email address blocked for six months.</p>
				<p>Proofreaders are Members who pay a $5 monthly fee to gain the ability to post reviews and rate stories. Proofreaders are held under slightly closer scrutiny then Members. a proofreader who breaks the rules is treated as if they were a member.</p>
				<p>Advanced Proofreaders are proofreaders who are selected for fairness and efficiency. They can leave edit suggestions on stories and in-depth reviews on characters, universes, or stories. any advanced proofreader who breaks the rules is banned for a year.</p>
				<p>The highest ordinary rank on Midstorm Repository are the moderators. Moderators enforce the rules of the site, and are drawn from the ranks of the Advanced Proofreaders. Moderators review flagged comments and approve or remove them. if a moderator is found breaking the rules, they are fired and fined $15, as they are employees of Midstorm Repository. They also are unable to ever make a Midstorm Repository account with the same email adress again.</p>
				<p>The Founder is the Ultimate Controller of the Moderators on Midstorm Repository. The Founder is responsable for disciplining or rewarding the moderators.</p>
					
					<h3>Flagging</h3>
						<p>you may flag a comment at any time by highlighting the icon of the flag in the upper right corner of the comment box. when a comment is flagged, all moderators get an alert. this alert directs them to the comment, where they then review it. frivilous flagging register as a strike against the flagger, as determined by the answering Moderator. removed comments result in a strike for the user who posted the comment. If a user has three strikes, which last for a year, then the user is banned according to their rank. each strike lasts a year before dissapating.</p>
						<p>If a Moderator removes a comment, other moderators can review the comment and reupload it. the moderator who removed the comment also gets a strike if the moderator who re-uploads it deems it necessary. Moderators who re-upload a comment then have the comment removed by a different moderator than the one who originally removed it are given two strikes.</p>
